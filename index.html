        <h3>Hi, there!</h3>
        <p>I'm Rachel, and you've found my LifeMap! Chances are that if you're reading this, you are a member of the Cozy community trying to learn more about me as an applicant. Throughout my life, I have been motivated and guided by my sense of place and role in my community. For this reason, I really reverberated with Cozy's mission to "solve big, meaningful problems that affect a basic human necessity: home." I thought I'd make this map to share more with you about the places that I've lived, worked, and most importantly, called home.

        <h3>Hometown</h3>
        <h4>Nashua, NH</h4>
        <p>Raised in New England, I grew up with a penchant for fresh air, Maine lobster, and Boston sports teams. My parents passed to me their love of learning, music, and gourmet food. When I recall "home," I'm bombarded with memories. Sledding down my street in 4 feet of fresh powder. Crunchy red leaves. My cat waking me up in the morning for school. Helping my mom in the garden. The smell of balsam and fir in pursuit of the perfect Christmas tree. Fishing with dad. Chili's cheeseburgers after high school football games. Love, and loss. Support, safety, belonging. </p>

        <h3>Undergraduate Studies</h3>
        <h4>Villanova University- Villanova, PA</h4>
        <p>Inclined to wander a bit further from home for my undergrad, I enrolled at Villanova University, just outside of Philadelphia. While my studies were focused in science, I found my home and my family witin the dusty old walls of the campus ministry building- next to people dedicated to serving the community and advocating for social justice. My eyes were opened to the extent of the privelege that I had grown up with, and I felt called to give my time to people who were less fortunate. I dove into the world of service, and over four years, wore many hats- tutor, mentor, carpenter, janitor, gardener, and (most importantly) friend. I found that no matter the hat I was wearing, people were usually most grateful for a human connection- for someone to recognize them and and their humanness and needs. To be held and supported in their current state.  These experiences rocked my world. With genuine, caring people by my side, I found my home at Villanova making music, cheering through the ups and downs of our beloved basketball team, exploring a vibrant city, and growing ever hungry to work for sustainable solutions in our communities.

        <h3>Jesuit Volunteer Corps Northwest, Americorps</h3>
        <h4>Juneau, AK</h4>
        <p>After graduation, I wasn't quite ready to end my social justice journey and committed my next year serving the youth of Juneau, AK as an Americorps volunteer with JVC Northwest. I worked in a space that acted as a home away from home and safe place for underpriveleged youth in the community. As the Young Parent and Healthy Teen Center Assistant, I worked to empower pregnant and parenting teens to access community and social servicces, find safe and affordable housing, and make healthy decisions for themselves and their children. I found my place in the community as a mentor,  advocate, and teacher. I felt at home in the dense, mossy rainforests, standing at the edge of ocean waters teeming with life. I was humbled to learn from a people and native culture so connected to the land and its natural bounty. I found solace in the mountains, sitting in a blueberry patch, in a tiny wilderness cabin watching whale spouts from the window.</p>

        <h3>A Long Walk</h3>
        <h4>Appalachian Trail Thru Hike</h4>
        <p>It had been a dream of mine to hike the Appalachian Trail ever since I met a thru hiker as a kid in the White Mountains of Hew Hampshire. After my year in Juneau, it felt like the perfect time to make that dream a reality. I started walking north on the AT in Georgia, all alone. I walked almost every day for six months until I reached the trail's northern terminus in Maine, except this time, I with friends- fellow hikers who had weathered the same 2,189.1 miles. I have never felt more at home then I did on the trail... an odd revelation, considering that I was living a completely transient life. I was at home not because of a connection to one specific place, but becasue of a feeling of belonging. I felt completely accepted by this odd community of strangers. I could be my most authentic self, without fear of judgement or rejection. I made deep, lasting friendships with people I'd only known a few weeks. I learned to succumb completely to the power and whim of the trail; to exist day to day without caring about much more than what I was going to eat for dinner. I learned to trust complete strangers, and to trust myself and my abilities. I learned to be at home in silence, uncertainty, fear, physical pain, and joy. </p>

        <h3>YMCA Bold and Gold</h3>
        <h4>Seattle, WA</h4>
        <p>My profound experience on the Appalachian Trail called me to share the power of the outdoors with others, specifically teens and youth. So, I packed up my car, invited my boyfriend, and drove across the country to work for the YMCA of Seattle as a wilderness instructor with its outdoor education progran, BOLD and GOLD. There, I led one and three week wilderness backpacking expeditions for groups of 8-12 high school students. With the crags and cliffs of the Olympic Coast Wilderness as my backdrop, I facilitated curriculum aimed at developing and instilling confidence, emotional intelligence, courage, and a sense of wonder in youth through experiential learning. For weeks at a time, home existed solely as the nylon walls of an open floor tent, and a sleeping bag filled with sand.  </p>

        <h3>Portland</h3>
        <p>As a recent transplant, I'm still finding my place and role in the Portland community. I'm connected through my relationships and extended family, but still seek meaningful vocation. Home and shelter is a basic human need, but it also contributes so much to the human expreience. It is identity and belonging, it builds relationships and hosts experiences that form people for the rest of their lives. I'm stoked about the idea of working for Cozy and contributing to a product that connects people with their community and their homes.  </p>
